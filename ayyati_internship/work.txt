Hi guys,

In the previous mail, I have given you some links which clearly explains php templating and Model-View-Controller approach. Now you can understand how MVC can make the maintenance of code easier. Now I want you guys to get familiar with a php framework called Symphony2. Here is the link.

http://symfony.com/

 Go through the documents as of now and do the installation part. And let me know when you are done with this.

Hi,

Hope you are comfortable working with Php framework.

Now I am sharing an image with you describes the basic layout of the site.

Please design the backend (not coding,but the idea) and send me. We will discuss each of your designs and come up with final database design.


So make sure to complete this task by tomorrow,i.e 4th June,2013.









Hi guys,
Hope you have gone through the image file describing the functionality of the website. 
Now you have to start working on the backend. 

This is the link of the word document which describes the database.

@Sidharth, you code for internship.php

@Rajul, you code for student.php

@Snehashis, code for index.php and employer.php and user.php. You create index.php and user.php and sent it to both sidhharth and Rajul, so that they can add them in their project.

I want you three people to communicate with each other and work together.

Please revert back to this mail.
